    "intro": "Programming is not just about writing code; it's also about how effectively you interact with your computer. Programming education often overlooks the importance of the 'development environment,' leading to frustration for many students. The 'development environment' encompasses all the tools needed for writing and running programs, which often require command-line instructions. Most programming environments are not Windows or Mac OS, but Linux. Linux Odyssey is an online interactive teaching website designed for this purpose.",
